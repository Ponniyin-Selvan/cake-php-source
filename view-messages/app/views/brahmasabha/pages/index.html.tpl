    <p>Brahma Sabha International promotes research into and the education of Indian arts, studies and culture to Indians and to non-Indian nationals residing outside India. Vedas, Sanskrit, Puranas, Bhajans, Indian music, dance, meditation, japa and yoga are cornerstone areas for the Brahma Sabha.</p>

    <p>Initially, the focus is on sponsoring various parayanam (scripture reading), katha shravanam (spiritual talks/discourses) and related activities. The organization is funded primarily through voluntary contributions, sponsorships and through the distribution of books, audio and video material dealing with Hindu spirituality and India related studies.</p>

    <p>Brahma Sabha utilizes Bhakti Marga (the path of devotion) as the foundation for Hinduism becoming a religion of the world. This Sabha will also serve as an international point of unity for the devotees of Sri Krishna Premi Maharaj.</p>

    <p>Brahma Sabha is renowned for its Hinduism research and education activities. It will promote inter faith, cross religious understanding and harmony with this strong base.</p>
