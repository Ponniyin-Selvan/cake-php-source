<h2>Unique aspects of Ponniyin Selvan</h2>
<ul class="slinks">{$socialLinks->display()}</ul>
<br />

<p>To begin with, I just thought I could summarize some of the unique features of Ponniyin Selvan as compared to other historic novels written in Tamil -</p>

<ul class="list">
<li>Most of the novels have a big invasion or fighting between 2 kingdoms as their climax. The entire novel will be moving towards this event and the author would have supported one side - portraying the other as the evil force. Kalki's own Sivakamiyin Sabadham is no exception to this.</li>
<li>But Ponniyin Selvan is different in this respect - to a careful observer it will be evident that the novel does'nt have a climax on its own! Kalki felt that the renunciation of Crown by Arulmizhi was his climax (refer his conclusion to the novel) - to many readers it is the murder of Aditya - but to me it is neither or both. That is why when you finish the novel, you always suffer from a sort of dissatisfaction - no other novel can give this feeling - that too at the end of 5th volume!</li>
<li>Most of the novels have a King or a prince as its hero - but in Ponniyin Selvan a small, insignificant and noble warrior (Vandhiyathevan) becomes a hero. It is interesting to note that Kalki actually wanted Arulmozhi to be recognized as a hero in his novel - the name Ponniyinselvan is derived from him - but an `all perfect' figure he portrayed only helped to distance readers from Arulmizhi. Moreover the chronology of events was also in favour of Vandhiyathevan. It is interesting to compare Vandhiyathevan with Paranjothi - who is a character in Sivakamiyin Sabadham and Ponnan of Parthiban Kanavu. In Sivakamiyin Sabadham Paranjothi character is used to introduce many characters in the Novel - but the real hero is Narasimhavarman. It is certain that Kalki wanted to adopt a similar technique but somehow Vandhiyathevan triumphed over his own creator!</li>
<li>Usually such long historic stories have to portray some breaks in timeline (invariably). For example, in Sivakamiyin Sabadham the last part happens after a gap of 9 years. But Ponniyin Selvan portrays events continuously for a period of 6 months. If you trace back carefully, you can actually find out who was doing what for almost every day - for a period of 6 months.</li>
<li>Probably its portrayal of simultaneous happenings in many many places is unique to Tamil historic novel genere. At some point of time, he will be detailing different events happening in Srilanka, Tanjore, Pazhaiyarai, Kudanthai and Kadambur - and yet -with master craftsmanship - will link them in a very logical order - as pages move by…</li>
<li>Its characterization of people is a well discussed and well researched topic.This is probably the only novel in which we see almost all kinds of love between human beings portrayed –
  <ul>
    <li>Vandhiyathevan and Kundhavai who are in love with each other since their first sight.</li>
    <li>Poonguzhali's love for Arulmozhi and her compromise to marry Amudhan</li>
    <li>Arulmozhi's interest in Poonguzhali and his compromise to marry vanathi</li>
    <li>Vanathi's love towords Arulmizhi</li>
    <li>Amudhan's love towords Poonguzhali</li>
    <li>Nandhini's love towords Aditya and her revenge</li>
    <li>Aditya's love towords Nandhini</li>
    <li>Parthibendhran's love towords Nandhini</li>
    <li>Pazhuvettaraiyar's interest in Nandhini</li>
    <li>Manimekalai's love towords Vandhiyathevan </li>
  </ul>
 </li>
</ul>
<p>Initially I thought of categorizing them (like one sided love, two sided love etc) but I find that it is difficult to do - given the wide spectrum of relationship kalki portrays!</p>
<ul class="list">
<li>Ponniyin Selvan is perhaps the only novel in which the story is not entirely dominated by Hero. Sometimes I think Ponniyin Selvan has different heros at different points of time…</li>
<li>In Pallipadai events (Part I) Azvarkadiyan sounds like a hero</li>
<li>In Nilavarai and many other occations, ofcourse Vandhiyathevan dominates</li>
<li>In Part II Arulmozhi dominates in many occasions</li>
<li>Sendhan amudhan surprisingly dominates certain portions in Part IV and V (During Mandakini escape from Pallakku, when he becomes royal heir etc)</li>
<li>During the aftermath of floods (Part IV), Pazhuvettaraiyar certainly becomes a hero for a chapter or two</li>
<li>Thus it is close to real life in which different people become heros at different points of time.</li>
<li>Surprise ! Ponniyin Selvan seems to have no villains! (or rather everybody seems to have enough justifications) Nandhini might sound like a villi but after reading her childhood we understand that there are enough reasons behind her abhorrence. Ravidasan ? Soman sambavan ? Remember they had vowed to give their life in case they fail to protect their leader. But instead they choose to live and take revenge. They undergo so many troubles to achieve their goal. Considering the cruelty of Pandiya's murder - this can be understood. In other words, the negative forces are also portrayed with possible realism a writer can bestow upon his characters.</li>
</ul>
<p>I can keep on writing many paragraphs like this….and yet may not able to fully portray the heights and depths of this greatest historic novel ever written.</p>
