<h2>Vallavaraiyan Vandhiyathevan</h2>

<p>Vallavarayan Vandhiyathevan was a real personality who existed in Chola regime under Rajaraja and before. His origins and clan are subjects of great debate(debate). From evidences gathered so far, there is absolutely nothing to prove his connectivity with Vaanar Kulam.</p>

<p>Sadasiva Pandarathar suggests that he might have belonged to eastern chalukyas - again without offering much evidence to support his claim.</p>

<p>Dr.Poovannan's research has some interesting insights on this. He has clearly quoted how Kalki had a very strong belief that Vandhiyathevan belonged to Vanar clam and he was even prepare to go against some of the well known historians of his times - in this.</p>

<p>The question is : <b>What made Kalki to believe so strongly that Vanthiyathevan was indeed a vaanan ?</b></p>

<p>Again, Vandhiyathevan does not speak about his father mother or family throughout the story ! and none of us think about this at all ! Once he speaks about his early childhood - but nowhere does he mention about his father etc. and how he is connected to vaanar kulam. The truth is that there is no historic evidence to support this. But Kalki should have had his own ideas behind this faith..what it was ? We might never know !!</p>

<p>Probably Kalki based his ideas on the fact that he was a king of a region around Vallam and this was ruled by Vanars earlier. It is quite possible that Vandhiyathevan was one of the small regional leadersâ€™ who accepted chola suprimacy and had close links with them like many other regional leaders of his time.</p>

<p>One interesting thing to note is that - in chola dynasty since Aditya chola - it has been a trend to strengthen their ties through marital alliances. Right from Aditya, Parantha and Sundara we see kings marrying many daughters - sometimes from potential would-be enemy empires and forge solid relationship with them. And in case of Vanthiyathevan , we see that he married Kundavai - perhaps the most powerful princess of her times. It's worthwhile to ponder whether this had any gains to chola empire. In this light, it makes sense to view Vanthiyathevan as a east chalukyan price -because - later, we see Rajaraja forging very strong relationship with them by giving his daughter to Vimaladitya - who is of chalukyan origin. (This resulted in a completely different set of chola-chalukya clan - from the time of Kulothungan I). It is evident that Rajaraja would not have experimented this marriage unless he had a strong faith in their relationship. This could have been due to Vanthiyathevan.</p>

<p>But things that contradict this idea are that Vanthiyathevan never went to Chalukyan kingdom - he peacefully reigned few regions under Rajaraja and was one of the leading generals of the army. Thus, we see that the arguement lacks enough strength to be accepted as a fact.</p>

<p>So much about Vanthiyathevan's origins !!</p>

<p>Coming to the Vanthiyathevan character which Kalki created, the first thing that should be held in mind is that - initially he was not intended to be a hero. Kalki wanted to sideline him - just like Paranjyothi of Sivakamiyin sabatham - after making use of him to introduce the characters and places. But it so happened that the character grew steadily on his own might - and in spite of the elaborate introductions - Arulmozhi failed to capture the hearts of people as much as Vanthiyathevan did. In fact - in certain portions where Vanthiyathevan is not featured for several chapters - we notice his absence so vividly that during his reappearance Kalki will write - " We have deserted our hero for a long time..." This is the first occation in which Kalki recognizes him as the true hero of this story. This is a typical example for the case in which imagination triumphs over its own creator.</p>

<p>Vanthiyathevan is closer to life than ever- perfect Arulmozhi. He makes many mistakes; heis quick in decisions and is often proud about his good looks. He undergoes the pleasures and pains of royal service. He is a true friend and a sincere lover.</p>

<p>The moment which I like most in the Kundavai - Vanthiyathevan love is this:</p>

<p>He is arrested by Anirudhar and placed inside the cell in Pazhaiyarai. Kundavi comes to visit him. After a few formal dialogues, Vanthiyathevan says that she is beyond his reach. At this moment, Kundavi gives her hands to him and says : " I come from a family of queens who hailed Karpu beyond their lives. Having touched your hands, in this lifetime - I'll not touch another man's hands"</p>

<p>This is the first occation in which they deliberately express their love towords each other. The subtle nature of true love is beautifully brought out by kalki in this sequence.</p>

<p>Also, the way Kalki expresses the first formal meeting between these two - is unforgettable. He will go to prehistoric times when man and woman were formed.....tell us a simple story - and will suddenly conclude " Vanthiyathevan and Kundavi were in such a state of mind "!</p>

<p>Vallavaraiyan Vanthiyathevan will live in the hearts of tamil reading community for many more generations to come.</p>
