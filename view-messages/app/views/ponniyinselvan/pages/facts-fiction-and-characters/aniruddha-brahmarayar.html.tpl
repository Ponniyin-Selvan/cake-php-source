<h2>Aniruddha Brahmarayar</h2>
<ul class="slinks">{$socialLinks->display()}</ul>
<br />

<p>The name aniruddha is derived from one of the Vyuha manifestations of Lord Vishnu. Altogether there are 4 forms (Vasudeva, Pradyumna, Sankarshana and Aniruddha).</p>

<p>Anbil was a recognized town in chola regime - probably because of its proximity to Uraiyur. Today it is a small village near trichy. There is a Vishnu temple of ancient origins located here. (Lord name is Appak kudathan)</p>

<p>Being born in a staunch vaishnavite family, the man we are talking about naturally got his name Aniruddha. Brahmarayan or Brahma marayan are various names given to brahmins involved in high society royal services - under the chola regime. Some of them enjoyed high privileges - under the power of autocracy.</p>

<p>We come to know of many details reg. sundara chola's period from anbil copper plates - which is dealt with in detail - in PS as well. (I'm yet to read the details of Anbil Plates – For Your Information)</p>

<p>The anbil plates not only talk abot royal family but also about the brahmaraya's family and these details are finely made use of by Kalki during the Rameswaram meeting between Azhvarkadiyan Nambi and Brahmarayar. (Iyya - are you the son of Ananthazhvan ? etc.etc.)</p>

<p>I don't find many details about this brahmaraya in some of the historical references I've been reading. Infact - as a rule - we find very little info about people who were associated with the royal service. The entire society seems to have revolved around the king and we only find details about the kings and their conquests:(.</p>

<p>From the PS point of view Aniruddha assumes very significant importance. Perhaps he is the only person who is aware of the birth secret of Nandhini as well as several other things concerning royal family. We find his role changing - and sometimes we even get confused as to which side he really belongs to (Kundavi once remarks -"Even God may not know what is in this man's mind !"). Aniruddha is a personification of intelligence and royal wisdom gained over a period of time. In the entire novel - he is perhaps the only one who behaves like a typical politician.</p>

<p>It is not clear whether he served Madhurantaka Uttama chola as well. Considering the fact that the killers of Aditya were brahmins - serving under chola regime (I'll talk about this - in detail - later) - and as on date historians are unable to identify the real motive behind this killing (I'll also deal about this in detail at a later date - don't get confused with this for the moment) - we are unable to acquitt the historical Aniruddha whole heartedly.</p>

<p>But - thanks to PS - atleast a section of tamil reading society will have the character created by Kalki in mind - percieving Anirudhha Brahmarayar as a person who keeps the welfare of chola kings above everything else.</p>

<p>If I happen to read the details of Anbil plates, I'll update this with further info on Aniruddha and his family.</p>

<h3>Doubts about Aniruddha’s Period of Service</h3>
<p>On reading my mail on PS Group, Lavanya – another co member remarked like this:</p>

<p>" read ur mail... was nice reading abt the great minister... a smallclarification... aniruddha was not the prime minister during the brief time of Uttama Chozhas rule...He came back under Raja Rajan's rule...."</p>

<p>Later on, when I read Balakumaran’s Udaiyar, a similar idea was expressed – that Senathipathi Krishnan Raman ana Mummudi chozha Brahmarayar (this is how inscriptions refer him) was Airuddha Brahmarayar and that his place was ammangudi – visited by PS group during mudhal yathirai.</p>

<p>I could not help out with the following questions about this claim:</p>

<ul class="list">
    <li>If I remember correctly, Uttama chola reigned for 15 years. If Aniruddha was minister during Sundara chola's time </li>
    <li>resigned himself for the next 15 years - and came back once again - then either he should have been too old during R.Raja's time or too young during Sundara's time. </li>
    <li>Going by PS, Aniruddha and Sundara are approximately of same age. Assuming that aniruddha was around 40 during sundara's reign, then he should be 55 during Rajaraja's reign - and could have served him for some years. But the problem with this is that Sundara died almost within a year of Aditya's death - unable to cope up with the loss of his son - and became "PonMaaligai Thungiya Devar" in pages of history. Thus we have to conclude that sundara died quite early - without even completing 50 years. I'm not sure whether this is true or not - considering the lifetime, reign and achievements of sundara. </li>
    <li>The other arguement is ofcourse - to assume that Aniruddha was much younger than Sundara - around 40 during the latter's times - as I said earlier. But becoming a prime minister at 40 is no joke and we may not have enough evidences to support this. </li>
    <li>But beyond all this age and other stuff, perhaps the most interesting question that shoots us is : WHY DID HE RESIGN DURING MATHURANTHAKA UTTAMA CHOLA'S REIGN ? </li>
    <li>Was it true that he was one of the suspects in Aditya's murder(as I've pointed out) and was acquitted only after the original criminals were nabbed - during Rajaraja's reign? </li>
    <li>Or was he so devoted to Sundara and Family and did not want to serve anybody else ? </li>
    <li>Did he wish ..like many of the citizens of his times...(as proven by Thiruvalangadu plates)...that Arumozhi should succeed Sundara ? seeing that the throne was given to Uttama - he resigned from the post ? </li>
    <li>What did he do when he was not in post ? Kept quiet or continued to serve chola dynasty and guide arumozhi ? (Note : Historical reference name is Arumozhi and *not* Arul - Mozhi as indicated in PS) </li>
</ul>
<p>To me, one thing is very clear : Unless somebody comes up and writes another 5 Volumes of Ponniyin Selvan - from that point where Kalki leaves us - many of the questions that are raised by history - may not be answered at all !</p>
