<h2>Preface</h2>

<p>Like thousands of Tamil reading population, I’ve been mesmerised by the magic of Ponniyin selvan since my 7th Standard. I keep reading it again and again – only to discover new things, new theories every time. This interest – in turn- inspired me to read lot of related material on Chola History. The result is this series of articles.</p>

<p>Herein, I’ve tried to compare the real historic figures with those portrayed in Ponniyin selvan. I’ve pointed out those facts and historic evidences, which go for as well against the events in the magnum opus. I’ve also tried to understand the thoughts and imaginations of Kalki –in depicting a particular incident or a happening.</p>

<p>Dr.Poovannan’s Phd research thesis on Kalki’s Historic Novels was a great inspiration behind my writings.</p>

<p>This document is – by no means, comprehensive – and should be treated as an ongoing reseach work. As and when I find new material – I will keep this document upto date. This whole set of articles have been compiled from a series of mails I posted in Ponniyin Selvan Yahoo group (http://groups.yahoo.com/group/ponniyinselvan/) earlier – under the common title “Ponniyin Selvan – Facts and fiction”.</p>

<p>My heartiest thanks to all the members of this group; they not only gave me an opportunity to share my thoughts and debated on them – but also provided new insights, more often than not.
Wherever possible, I have tried to include the comments of other members and my reactions to their opinions. But – for obvious reasons, I could not do full justification to all opinions and comments that arose. Readers are encouraged to read old mail archives – if they want to know more about specific issues or debates.</p>

<p>My sincere thanks to Ms.Pavitra Srinivasan, an enthusiastic and elite member of this group - for proof reading and editing the whole document.</p>
